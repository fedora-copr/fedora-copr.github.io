Let me sum up what the Copr team did during 2021

### Mock

We did eight releases of Mock.

We moved Mock’s wiki to GitHub Pages to allow indexing by search engines https://rpm-software-management.github.io/mock/ and created a Fedora-based Jekyll container for local documentation testing (https://github.com/praiskup/jekyll-github-pages-fedora-container). 

We initiated the discussion about default epel-8-* config


### Copr

We did six releases of Copr and upgraded Copr servers to Fedora 35.

We wrote three “4 cool new projects to try in Copr” articles for [Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org/).

[We rebuilt all gems from Rubygems.org for Fedora Rawhide](http://frostyx.cz/posts/rebuilding-the-entire-rubygems-in-copr).

[We started to use AWS Spot instances for builders](https://pavel.raiskup.cz/blog/aws-instances.html).

[We started to decommission APIv1 and APIv2](https://fedora-copr.github.io/posts/EOL-APIv1-APIv2-pt2).

You have [an option to run a fedora-review after each build](http://frostyx.cz/posts/running-fedora-review-after-copr-build).

We created [a new Ansible module `copr` which is available in community general collection](https://fedora-copr.github.io/posts/new-ansible-module-copr)

[You can order your builds using batches now](https://pavel.raiskup.cz/blog/build-ordering-by-batches-in-copr.html)

People started using discussion under projects. There are more than one hundred active discussions https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/projects-in-copr/54 

We redesigned Copr’s home page.

We worked on clean-up scripts resulting in 5+ TB cleaned from our backends.

We did six releases of `resalloc` with improvements for better throughput and reactions during peeks. https://github.com/praiskup/resalloc/ 

[Copr’s servers got IPv6](https://pavel.raiskup.cz/blog/switch-fedora-box-to-ipv6-in-aws.html)

We did three releases of `prunerepo` https://pagure.io/prunerepo 

We [added lots of builders and some architectures](https://pavel.raiskup.cz/blog/copr-farm-of-builders.html) and later we re-add ppc64le architecture, and started using spot AWS instances

We implemented Error Budget and our goal is:

 * 97 % of builds of copr-ping package is finished within 6 minutes (this monitor length of queue and speed of builders)
 * 99,3 % uptime of CDN
 * 99,3 % uptime of copr-backend (dnf repositories) (cca 5h/month)
 * 97.5 % uptime of copr-frontend (WebUI) (cca 18h/month)

There is work in progress on Kerberos authentication in copr-cli.

Statistics:

 * Copr run 2,900,000 builds.
 * People created 15 731 new projects.



### Fedora

We created [a Fedora Sponsor site to easy find of a sponsor](https://docs.pagure.org/fedora-sponsors/).

We created [a video explaining a dist-git](https://youtu.be/VsnJymZRQOM).

We proposed [Retired Packages change](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/RetiredPackages) and it got accepted.

We created [license-validate tool](https://pagure.io/copr/license-validate/).


### Others

We did four releases of [Tito](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/tito).

We wrote an article about [activating no-cost RHEL](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/10/how-to-activate-your-no-cost-red-hat-enterprise-linux-subscription). 

We wrote three articles about storing GPG keys in DNS and persuaded several distributions to put the records in DNS https://github.com/xsuchy/distribution-gpg-keys/#storing-keys-in-dns 

New `modulemd-tools` release with "bld2repo" tool.


### Outlook for 2022

We are in the middle of talking with IBM, which should result in the availability of native s390x builders in the early months of 2022

We had an initial meeting about rebase-helper automatically opening PR in src.fedoraproject.org. There is even some code written (by Michal Konečný), but the code is not integrated yet and no user-visible outcome was done yet. ETA is the first half of 2022.

Python team deprecated `pyp2rpm` and Karolina Surma is writing a new tool from scratch and she will use it for the rebuild of PyPI in Copr in a similar way to how we have done Rubygems. ETA is early months or 2022.

Unify forge events - when an “interesting” event happens on GitHub/GitLab/* sent notification to Fedora Messaging in a unified format. Besides Copr, this will be useful for Packit too.


s we have for 2022 - some of them are inherited from the previous year:

Finish rpm-spec-wizard https://github.com/xsuchy/rpm-spec-wizard

Integration with Koshei - automatic rebuild of your package in your project when dependency change

Enhance `Mock --chain` to try to set %bootstrap when the standard loop fails. When the set succeeds, rebuild the bootstrapped package again without the %bootstrap macro. 

Contribute to fedpkg/koji to have machine-readable output.

Building VM images for Cloud (osbuild-composer)

If you have any idea which can ease packaging (especially the automation) then do not hesitate and share it with us. We may do that!


The Community Packaging Team consists of Pavel Raiskup, Silvie Chlupova, Jakub Kadlcik, and Miroslav Suchý.


Curious what [we did in 2020](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/R2MWYN7CRF34WKSRUUYNLAISQB47MHXI/)?
