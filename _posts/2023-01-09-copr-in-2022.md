Let me sum up what the Copr team did during 2022.

Mock:
* We did six [releases of Mock](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/mock/#release-notes) Starting with a major upgrade to 3.x that dropped python2 support and EL7 as the host platform. 
* We added `--list-chroots` option. Allow better customization of used tar binary and adapt to the new split of qemu-user-static package.
* We also added lots of new chroots: AlmaLinux, RockyLinux, EuroLinux, OpenEuler, and a few others…

Copr:
* We did [nine releases of Copr](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release_notes.html) and upgraded Copr servers to Fedora 37.
* We wrote two “[4 cool new projects to try in Copr”](https://fedoramagazine.org/4-cool-new-projects-to-try-in-copr-for-august-2022/) articles for Fedora Magazine
* Beside previously built of all gems from Rubygems.org we built all modules from PyPI as RPM packages [Thousands of PyPI and RubyGems RPMs now available for RHEL 9 | Red Hat Developer](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/06/07/thousands-pypi-and-rubygems-rpms-now-available-rhel-9) Big thanks to Karolina Surma from Python team on cooperation on this. As a side effect, we introduced pyp2spec as a second option to build directly from PyPI.
* We [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSgGno0oecs) at Fedora Nest.
* We dropped APIv2. And provided guidance how to migrate your scripts [https://fedora-copr.github.io/posts/api3-migration-helper](https://fedora-copr.github.io/posts/api3-migration-helper) 
* We added Kerberos authentication to command line tools and API [https://fedora-copr.github.io/posts/how-to-use-kerberos-in-copr](https://fedora-copr.github.io/posts/how-to-use-kerberos-in-copr) 
* We cooperated with Packit on building SRPM in Copr [https://packit.dev/postcs/copr-srpms/](https://packit.dev/posts/copr-srpms/) 
* We started using IBM Cloud for native s390x builders  [https://pavel.raiskup.cz/blog/fedora-copr-uses-ibm-cloud.html](https://pavel.raiskup.cz/blog/fedora-copr-uses-ibm-cloud.html) \
As a side effect we packaged python modules for managing resources in IBM Cloud.
* We spent lots of time optimizing the scheduler in Copr. E.g.
    * Builds from webhooks are now background jobs [https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-02-03.html#webhook-rebuilds-are-background-jobs-now](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-02-03.html#webhook-rebuilds-are-background-jobs-now) 
    * We improved the throughput when the queue is bigger than 70k jobs [https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-03-21.html#large-queue-improvements](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-03-21.html#large-queue-improvements)
    * And we were able to increase quota of parallel builds from one user from 35 to 45.
* We started using SHA256 for signing packages [https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-03-21.html#signing-packages-with-sha256](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-03-21.html#signing-packages-with-sha256) 
* We started using OpenPGP v4 signatures and we were one of the first to discover issues with new Sequoia backend of RPM with older version of signatures.
* We created a webUI statistics page that shows the utilization of [resalloc](https://github.com/praiskup/resalloc) resources https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-06-22.html#resalloc-webui
* We (finally) were able to count download statistics from CDN [https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-08-18.html#rpm-download-statistics](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-08-18.html#rpm-download-statistics) 
* You can submit more builds at once from command line [https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-07-27.html#submitting-multiple-builds-at-once-via-copr-cli](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-07-27.html#submitting-multiple-builds-at-once-via-copr-cli) 
* We upgraded aarch64 builders to stronger Graviton3 machines [https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-11-28.html#updated-aarch64-builders-to-graviton3-processors](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-11-28.html#updated-aarch64-builders-to-graviton3-processors) 
* We migrated our git project to GitHub [https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-11-28.html#development-moved-to-github](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/release-notes/2022-11-28.html#development-moved-to-github) 
* We migrated to new storage as we hit 16 TB hard limit for one volume in AWS. It took us few weeks of preparation to make just a few hour outage for building packages and almost no outage for yum repositories availability.
* Fedora Infrastructure helped us to provision a new Power9 box (for ppc64le builds) which hosts 25 builders (which complements the set of Power9 machines in OSUOSL). Note that Power9+ is needed for Enterprise Linux 9 builds.
* We created OpenShift and Kustomize deployment script.
* Statistics:
    * Copr run 1 251 633 builds (one package for different chroots is conted as one)
    * People created 23 053 new projects.

Fedora:
* We participated in SPDX License migration phase 1 [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/SPDX_Licenses_Phase_1](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/SPDX_Licenses_Phase_1) 
* We announced the initial release of Package Review service [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E4TT2PEOSITJ4PJP44L2GQUU4CA6R6B3/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/E4TT2PEOSITJ4PJP44L2GQUU4CA6R6B3/) 
* We contributed to fedora-review to produce machine-readable output [https://pagure.io/FedoraReview/pull-request/463](https://pagure.io/FedoraReview/pull-request/463)
* One [modulemd-tools release](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/modulemd-tools/releases/tag/modulemd-tools-0.13-1).
* FIXME another notable fedora-review contribution?

Others:
* We did three [releases](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/tito/releases) of Tito
* We did seven [releases](https://github.com/praiskup/resalloc/releases) of Resalloc
* RPM Spec Wizard [got a nice front page](http://frostyx.cz/posts/introducing-rpm-spec-wizard) [https://xsuchy.github.io/rpm-spec-wizard/](https://xsuchy.github.io/rpm-spec-wizard/)
* Copr users are known to build the same NEVRAs multiple times in the same project, which confuses DNF and other tools.  We contributed to createrepo_c [https://github.com/rpm-software-management/createrepo_c/pull/325](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/createrepo_c/pull/325) which is the first step to deterministically resolve the problem.
* The “differential PyLint checker” we used for the last few years was separated from the Copr base code into [https://github.com/fedora-copr/vcs-diff-lint](https://github.com/fedora-copr/vcs-diff-lint) and it can now be easily used by other projects. We also provide a “glue” GitHub Action wich makes it’s use trivial, see integration example [https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/blob/main/.github/workflows/python-diff-lint.yml](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/blob/main/.github/workflows/python-diff-lint.yml) 

Outlook for 2023
* Integration with Koshei - automatic rebuild of your package in your project when dependency changes (inherited from the previous year - not even started yet)
* Hopefully start using ImageBuilder.
* We are investigating the usage of [Pulp](https://pulpproject.org/) as a backend for storing RPM packages.

Ideas we have for 2023 - some of them are inherited from the previous year:
* Enhance `Mock --chain` to try to set %bootstrap when the standard loop fails. When the set succeeds, rebuild the bootstrapped package again without the %bootstrap macro. 
* Contribute to fedpkg/koji to have machine-readable output. FIXME
* Include packages from Copr in results of [https://packages.fedoraproject.org/](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/)
* Allow running various tools right after the build - e.g., rpminspect, swidtags.
* Automatically verify if your package’s license can be used in Copr.

The Community Packaging Team consists of Pavel Raiskup, Jakub Kadlcik, Jiří Kyjovský (who replaced Silvie Chlupova), and me.
