title: Proxies for Copr repositories

I just enabled the content delivery network (CDN) for Copr repositories.
It is provided by [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). And it is provided for free by Amazon to Fedora.

Technically the original URL

    copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org

is now accessible using

    download.copr.fedorainfracloud.org

The original URL is and will be available. You can still use it. The second one is CNAME for the CDN and should be much
faster for you.

The CDN is automatically enabled for new projects. Though, if you already have enabled some copr repository on your
workstation/server, it will still use the old URL.
It is fine; it will continue to work.
If you want to enable CDN for your repos you have to run:

    dnf copr enable some/project

for every copr project you have enabled. Or manually change the URL in the repo file.

If you experience any problem with CDN, please let me know.
